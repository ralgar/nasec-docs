# Navigating the Linux Terminal

## Basic Concepts

The terminal in linux is like communicating with your computer directly.
Instead of having graphical apps make the system calls for you, you directly
tell the computer what to do.

Here are some basic concepts to understand so you can intuitively tell what the terminal is doing.

-Everything (and I do mean everything) in linux is a file. Even the hardware in your
 computer is represented by a file.
-While using a terminal you will always be somewhere in the file structure. You can
 think of it as a file manager except you as the user are in the location you are looking at.
-Every command you run will be run in the location you are in (unless you specify otherwise).

Here's a really well-written explanation on basic navigation in the Linux terminal.

**NOTE:** You might notice that the author of this blog post is actually using
 a Mac. It doesn't matter. The terminal is *very* similar on both Mac and Linux.

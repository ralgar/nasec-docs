# Navigating the Linux Terminal

## Basic Concepts

The terminal in Linux is just a way to communicate with your computer
 directly. Instead of having graphical apps make system calls for you,
 you directly tell the computer what to do using commands.

Here are some basic concepts to understand so you can intuitively
 understand what the terminal is doing:

- Everything (and I do mean everything) in Linux is a file.
  Even the hardware in your computer is represented by a file.
- While using a terminal you will always be somewhere in the
  filesystem structure. You can think of it as a file manager, except
  you as the user are in the directory you are looking at.
- Every command you run will be run in the directory you are
  currently in (unless you specify otherwise).

Here's a really well-written explanation on basic navigation in the Linux terminal.

**NOTE:** You might notice that the author of this blog post is actually using
 a Mac. It doesn't matter. The terminal is *very* similar on both Mac and Linux.
